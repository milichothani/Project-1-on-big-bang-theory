Sure! Here’s the README with more emojis added for a lively touch:
Big Bang Theory Simulation in C++ 🌌✨
Overview

This project simulates the Big Bang Theory using the graphics.h library in C++. 
The aim is to visualize the explosive formation of the universe, 
illustrating key concepts like the expansion of space and the formation of celestial bodies. 🚀🌍
Features

    Big Bang Explosion 💥: A visual representation of the initial explosion that marks the beginning of the universe.
    Solar System Formation 🌞🪐: Animated emergence of the sun and eight planets, showing their orbits and relative positions.
    Interactive Elements 🎮: Users can explore different phases of the simulation with keyboard controls.

    Requirements

    C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) 🖥️
    graphics.hpp  library ,SFML library📚
    Basic understanding of C++ programming and graphics concepts 📖

    Usage

    Arrow Keys ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️: Navigate through the different phases of the simulation.
    Spacebar ␣: Pause or resume the animation.
    Esc ❌: Exit the simulation.
    //USE THE FOLLOWING CODE TO CLONE THE REPOSITORY
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/big-bang-simulation.git
    cd big-bang-simulation
